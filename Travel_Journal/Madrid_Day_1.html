        <h1>Day 1 in Madrid, Flea Market</h1>
        <p><strong>Date:</strong> Sunday 11/5/2023</p>
        <p><strong>Location:</strong> Madrid</p>

        <p>
            Arrived by train [from Sevilla] late last night in Madrid.
        </p>

        <p>
            My Hostel, 2060 Newton, will be hard to beat for the rest of my trip.
            Clean, comfortable, private, and social; perfect combination. They
            provide sleeping ‘modules;’ first time I have seen this, but I am a fan.
        </p>

        <p>
            I left my hostel for the first time to check out the city. I walked one
            block in a direction of my choice, and next thing I knew the streets were
            full of people in a street sale/flea market. For the next few hours I would
            wander through the rows full of people buying and selling just about
            anything you can think of. It changed from block to block: some streets were
            selling clothes, others books, others plants, and others that seemed to be selling
            anything for the right price. On one corner there were three poets set up, and
            for a few bucks they would cut a poem on an old typewriter. They looked so much
            like poets that I don’t even think it was a costume.

        <p>
            The market seemed to go on forever, and it was the perfect day of unplanned
            exploration in a new city. I ended up buying Cole a 2012 Spain Euro jersey
            with ‘Cruzcampo’ as the name on the back.

        <p>
            Sundays are a great day for exploring these cities. Saturdays are often about
            the night, but Sundays are about the daytime. It felt like everyone was
            out, enjoying the day and enjoying their city.
