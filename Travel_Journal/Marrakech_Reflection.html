        <h1>Reflection on Marrakech</h1>
        <p><strong>Date:</strong> Tuesday 11/24/2023</p>
        <p><strong>Location:</strong> Marrakech</p>

        <p>
            Sights, sounds, and scents of Marrakech – nothing could have prepared me for it.
        </p>

        <p>
            My first day in Morocco I was nervous venturing into the unknown world outside the
            hostel, so I dragged my feet in the morning. But why?! The best experiences are hidden in the unknown.
        </p>

        <p>
            I recorded a video of the walk from my hostel out to what I considered the “main road”
            so that I could find my way back if I were lost later. In the medina, roads turn into walkways,
            walkways turn into alleys, and alleys will disappear altogether.
            I didn’t want to get lost; not yet at least.
        </p>

        <p>
            As a newcomer, the walled city of Marrakech feels like a place where magic exists.
            Built on trade, Jemaa El Fna, the central market, is the city’s beating heart, with
            a network of souks branching off to form its essential arteries. Wandering through
            its labyrinth of markets, the medina evokes an intoxicating sense of mystery; this alleyway
            sells incense, tortoises, and berber artwork, the next alley may reasonably carry a flying
            carpet, or genie in a bottle.
        </p>

        <p>
            Engaging with the city is a whole body experience. Spice carts, incense, and street food;
            pyramids of fruit, overflowing storefronts, and dusty alleys on the backdrop of red adobe
            under the desert sun; whining motorbikes, clopping hooves, and the buzz of the crowd. Beyond
            just the senses, exploring the city is emotional. The bustle of the city is inescapably human,
            and as a tourist willing to spend money I felt like an active member of the city, rather than
            an observer. Walking past every cart, shop, grill, and restaurant tourists are hailed down,
            and it took learning the hard way to avoid being scammed and coerced. In contrast to the
            confidence of salesmen is the pity of the beggars, who vary age, weight, gender, disability,
            and deformity. I lost sleep on a few occasions, thinking of the conditions of some of the city's beggars.
        </p>

        <p>
            The magic of Jemaa El Fna transforms from the markets by day to intrigue at night. Appearing at a
            distance as an opening in the otherwise tightly bunched buildings, smoke drifts upward from grills,
            cigarettes, and incense in the square, glowing from the bright lights of the vendors below. Musicians
            play traditional berber songs with other listeners gathered round, but taking a step back the music
            disappears into the cacophony of the square. Alongside the grills and shops of the daytime are
            entertainers: dancers, storytellers, gamblers, and musicians among others gathered in tight circles,
            each abutting the next, and competing for the attention of onlookers. The overstimulation of the square
            by day is doubled by night, and after only a few minutes of observing it at night I felt a headache coming
            on and went back to my hostel. Being that I was alone, I did not explore other parts of the city at night,
            so I guess I will have to do that next time.
        </p>

            Marrakech required some getting used to, but once I had adjusted to it I found it by far my most
            rewarding travel experience. After a month in western European cities they all felt the same, and
            Marrakech embodied different. Culture, religion, history, climate, architecture, landscape – all
            stood in contrast to what I had seen in Europe to that point. Importantly, however, I felt as safe
            in the medina of Marrakech as any other city I’ve been.Tourism is well established, vital to their
            local economy, and makes many aspects of travel easier. People are proud of their country and history,
            and my interactions in the city were overwhelmingly positive. Not only was this, by the end, my favorite
            stop, but it will be the first stop I return to, as there is so much yet to see.
