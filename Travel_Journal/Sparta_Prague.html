        <h1>Sparta Prague Game</h1>
        <p><strong>Date:</strong> Saturday 12/9/2023</p>
        <p><strong>Location:</strong> Prague</p>

        <p>
            After a few days in Prague I decided to head out on my own to find a more authentic experience for dinner.
            I walked a few blocks into a neighborhood and found a dive bar. I was uncomfortable at first, when I stood
            inside the doorway for a good few seconds without being greeted. There was only one server, a middle aged
            Czech woman who didn’t speak any English, but fortunately she was talking to a local who could get by and
            conveyed my request for a table.
        </p>

        <p>
            I sat myself in the back corner. The bar was homey and the few tables that were occupied were sat with local
            Czech speakers. The lone TV was playing a rerun of a Sparta Prague game.
        </p>

        <p>
            The english menu provided a rough translation, but it was much better than no english menu at all. I ordered
            “marinated herring with onions” and “beef goulash” with no idea what to expect, but it ended up being one of
            the best meals I had on my whole trip, not least because it was similar to New England comfort food. I
            enjoyed many different cities, but in Prague I felt I belonged the most in Prague.
        </p>

        <p>
            I left the restaurant in a good mood after a great meal and an unplanned little adventure. On the way out I
            saw the server and the helpful local outside having a smoke, and they were proud of their city and delighted
            to have welcomed me in for dinner. When they asked if there was anything that I needed help with in Prague,
            I remembered the Sparta Prague game on their TV, and I asked about the best way to get tickets to Saturday’s game.
        </p>

        <p>
            With the cheery old local translating again, the two of them conversed on my question for a second.
        </p>

        <p>
            When he turned back to me, he asked who Sparta Prague was playing. Specifically, he looked to confirm if they
            were playing Jablonec, a team from the north of the Czech Republic.
        </p>

        <p>
            When I confirmed that it was Sparta Prague vs. Jablonec, the server's face seemed to change and she stepped back inside the restaurant.
        </p>

        <p>
            Confused, I looked at my translator and he informed me that her nephew was a player on Jablonec. A few seconds
            later she emerged from the restaurant with her reading glasses on holding her phone, and asked how many tickets
            I wanted for Saturday's game, and what time I could come collect them the next day.
        </p>

        <p>
            When I said 7pm, they looked at each other and said that by 7pm they would be too drunk. How about 6pm?
        </p>

        <p>
            And so a great day just got better. I returned the next day, collected my ticket, and had an equally delicious meal
            of slow cooked “pork knuckle.” Touched by their generosity, I left a tip of over 100% of the bill, still less than 20 USD,
            which she tried to reject but I insisted she keep. By this time I had connected to their wifi and was communicating via
            google translate. Chatting on the way out, I asked how I could recognize her nephew. Proud of her family and still thanking
            me for my tip, she told me to come back on Saturday before I left for the game. The next day, I stopped back in before catching
            a taxi, and she handed me an envelope with two autographed player cards of Tomáš Hübschman, her nephew and captain of Jablonec.
        </p>

        <p>
            When I found my seat later that night, it was in the second row of the friends and family section of the away team.
        </p>

        <p>
            Sparta Prague, the heavy favorites, went on to win 3-0.
        </p>

        <p>
            What an experience! The best traveling comes from engaging with others. On top of an almost unbelievable coincidence, it is the pride
            and generosity of my friends at the pub that I will remember the most.
