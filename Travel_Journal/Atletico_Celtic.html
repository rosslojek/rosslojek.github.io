        <h1>Champions League Group Stage: Atletico Madrid vs. Glasgow Celtic</h1>
        <p><strong>Date:</strong> Tuesday 11/7/2023</p>
        <p><strong>Location:</strong> Madrid</p>

        <p>
            Yesterday on a walking tour of Madrid I met a German named Johannes, and we
            got along well. Not only was he a soccer fan, but we both had tickets to
            Atletico Madrid vs. Glasgow Celtic, and our seats were only two sections apart.
            What a coincidence!
        </p>

        <p>
            We agreed to meet at the main plaza and go to the game together. As it turned
            out, Celtic supporters had the same idea and we ended up smack in the middle of the
            visiting fans as they traveled from the center of Madrid to the Civitas
            Metropolitan.
        </p>

        <p>
            Over the last two days or so there had been a noticeable amount of Scots in
            town. By noticeable, I mean anywhere I looked, anywhere in the city, I would
            spot a group of three bald guys with hands on hips and a full-zip sweatshirt
            tied around waist exposing the unmistakable green and white stripes. They fit in
            like clowns at a funeral amongst the Spaniards.
        </p>

        <p>
            The powers at be, both the Scottish supporters clubs and the Spanish
            authorities, orchestrated the entire trip. Surrounded by police, we were herded
            into a subway station, leaving behind the obvious debris of any drunken mob.
            The station, packed shoulder to shoulder from the entrance stairway all the way
            to the platform, was absorbed by waves of pandemonium as they broke out in the
            songs of their homeland. One person would start, and the station would erupt,
            "We're Glasgow Celtic, We're the best team in Scotland," accompanied by the
            banging of trash barrels, ceiling panels, and the station walls.
        </p>

        <p>
            Riot police finally got us to the platform, where an entire train had been
            reserved for the traveling fans. My estimate is 11 cars for fans and at least
            one car reserved for just riot police.
        </p>

        <p>
            When we made it to the stadium, Johannes and I, being grouped in with the away
            supporters, were corralled into the away fan entrance, despite our actual
            tickets being on the opposite side of the stadium. There was no negotiating
            with the riot police, though, and when we saw a Celtic fan get roughed up we
            decided not to test their patience. Inside the next checkpoint, we found a more
            reasonable security guard, and we eventually made it to our section.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Celtic section was probably 6,000-8,000 people, but there were other Scots
            everywhere in the stadium; maybe 10,000-12,000 total, or 15% of the total
            crowd.
        </p>

        <p>
            Celtic came in as the underdog, and it was understood that they would need a
            near-perfect performance to leave Madrid with points. In an unfortunate turn of
            events, this plan fell apart when Griezmann put Atletico 1-0 up on a half-chance
            at 6 minutes. Bad start for Celtic. 20 minutes in and things went from bad to
            worse, as Celtic went down to 10 on a red card that should never have been
            called, especially because VAR overruled the call on the field. At this point,
            the game was basically finished, and the first half ended 2-0 to Madrid. If the
            first half was bad, the second half was noncompetitive.
        </p>

        <p>
            What was worse than Celtic conceding their 5th and 6th goals was that it was
            in front of an increasingly empty stadium as, after traveling all that distance
            to support their team, the Scottish fans had seen enough, and most of them had
            left the stadium by that point.
        </p>

        <p><strong>FT Atletico 6 - 0 Celtic</strong></p>

        <p>
            Griezmann played really well, scoring two goals and creating many more chances
            as Atletico’s most creative player.
        </p>

        <p>
            On the subway back there was one lonely Scot in our car who continued to sing
            his heart out, insisting between verses that they “were good in Scotland.” He
            couldn’t even see straight.
