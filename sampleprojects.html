                Abstract:
                <br />
                The emergence of the online gig economy has fundamentally changed employment relationships.
                The use of online platform marketplaces subjects workers to short term changes in supply and
                demand, and creates the potential for worker exploitation. The guiding principle of labor in these
                markets is flexibility, but the rigid nature of existing legislature and the corresponding
                perspectives of policymakers limit feasible regulation. A potential compromise to the particular
                situation of the gig economy is the development of a wage determination algorithm based on
                continuous inputs. The reliance of current perspectives on discrete inputs limits possible
                solutions, allows for loopholes, and polarizes the lead firm. This paper proposes a continuous
                wage determination model, the logistic marginal farebox, that increases benefits of workers most
                reliant on gig work, while maintaining the flexibility necessary in these markets.

                Description:
                <br />
                This is an econometric project in R that uses a few multivariate regression models to analyze the
                market value of professional soccer players in Europe's top leagues. The aim is to determine if nationality,
                specifically English nationality, has an effect on a players value when controlling for performance related
                factors.
