        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="bio">
            <p>I am a <b>learner</b>. I am passionate about using <b>data</b> to improve our 
            understanding of problems and solutions, particularly as it relates to <b>equity</b> and
            <b>sustainability</b>. As a natural communicator, I am well suited to <b>collaboration</b>
            and presentation of findings. I have experience in data analysis, data visualization,
            econometrics, and business intelligence in R, Tableau, SQL, and Python, as well as 
            programming experience in Python, Java, and C++.</p>

            <p>My research interests are on the intersection of <b>labor markets</b> and 
            <b>technology</b>. How can we best leverage technology to improve social welfare? 
            My highlighted work below, titled, “The Logistic Marginal Farebox,” is an example of 
            this research as it relates to the gig economy.</p>

            <p>In my free time, I spend time with friends and family, when I am not either playing or watching
            <b>soccer</b>. When asked, I tell people my favorite team is Crystal Palace, but I really just enjoy
            watching the passion, creativity, and cultural diversity of the game.</p>
