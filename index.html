        <div class="bio">
            <p>I am a <b>learner</b>. I am passionate about using <b>data</b> to improve our 
            understanding of problems and solutions, particularly as it relates to <b>equity</b> and
            <b>sustainability</b>. As a natural communicator, I am well suited to <b>collaboration</b>
            and presentation of findings. I have experience in data analysis, data visualization,
            econometrics, and business intelligence in R, Tableau, SQL, and Python, as well as 
            programming experience in Python, Java, and C++.</p>

            <p>My research interests are on the intersection of <b>labor markets</b> and 
            <b>technology</b>. How can we best leverage technology to improve social welfare? 
            My highlighted work below, titled, “The Logistic Marginal Farebox,” is an example of 
            this research as it relates to the gig economy.</p>

            <p>In my free time, I spend time with friends and family, when I am not either playing or watching
            <b>soccer</b>. When asked, I tell people my favorite team is Crystal Palace, but I really just enjoy
            watching the passion, creativity, and cultural diversity of the game.</p>

                Abstract: 
                <br />The emergence of the online gig economy has fundamentally changed employment relationships.
                The use of online platform marketplaces subjects workers to short term changes in supply and
                demand, and creates the potential for worker exploitation. The guiding principle of labor in these
                markets is flexibility, but the rigid nature of existing legislature and the corresponding
                perspectives of policymakers limit feasible regulation. A potential compromise to the particular
                situation of the gig economy is the development of a wage determination algorithm based on
                continuous inputs. The reliance of current perspectives on discrete inputs limits possible
                solutions, allows for loopholes, and polarizes the lead firm. This paper proposes a continuous
                wage determination model, the logistic marginal farebox, that increases benefits of workers most
                reliant on gig work, while maintaining the flexibility necessary in these markets.
