        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="bio">
            <p>I am a <b>learner</b>. I am passionate about using <b>data</b> to improve our 
            understanding of problems and solutions, particularly as it relates to <b>equity</b> and
            <b>sustainability</b>. As a natural communicator, I am well suited to <b>collaboration</b>
            and presentation of findings. I have experience in data analysis, data visualization,
            econometrics, and business intelligence in R, Tableau, SQL, and Python, as well as 
            programming experience in Python, Java, and C++.</p>

            <p>
                My research interests are on the intersection of <b>labor markets</b> and
                <b>technology</b>. How can we best leverage technology to improve social welfare?
                My highlighted work, titled,
                <a href="Documents/Logisitic Marginal Farebox.pdf" target="_blank">'The Logistic Marginal Farebox,'</a> is an example of
                this research as it relates to wage equity in the gig economy.
            </p>

            <p>In my free time, I enjoy the outdoors or being with friends and family. I also play a lot of
            <b>soccer</b>, and when I am not playing myself, I am probably watching soccer. When asked, I tell people
            my favorite team is Crystal Palace, but I really just enjoy the passion, creativity, and cultural diversity of the game.</p>
