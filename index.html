        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="bio">
            <p>
                I am a <b>learner</b>. I am passionate about using <b>data</b> to improve our
                understanding of problems and solutions, particularly as it relates to <b>equity</b> and
                <b>sustainability</b>. As a natural communicator, I am well suited to <b>collaboration</b>
                and presentation of findings. I have experience in data analysis, data visualization,
                econometrics, and business intelligence in R, Tableau, SQL, and Python, as well as
                programming experience in Python, Java, and C++.
            </p>

            <p>
                My research interests are on the intersection of <b>labor markets</b> and
                <b>technology</b>. How can we best leverage technology to improve social welfare?
                My highlighted work, titled,
                <a href="Documents/Logisitic Marginal Farebox.pdf" target="_blank">The Logistic Marginal Farebox</a>, is an example of
                this research as it relates to wage equity in the gig economy.
            </p>

            <p>
                In my free time, I enjoy the outdoors or being with friends and family. I also play a lot of
                <b>soccer</b>, and when I am not playing myself, I am probably watching soccer. When asked, I tell people
                my favorite team is Crystal Palace, but I really just enjoy the passion, creativity, and cultural diversity of the game.
            </p>
