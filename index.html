        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="bio">
<p>
    I am a <b>team builder</b>, <b>decision maker</b>, and <b>rideshare analyst</b> improving how people get around cities and earn a living in the gig economy.
</p>

<p>
    I currently work at Empower, an improved model of the <b>ridehailing industry</b>. I was the first <b>business analyst</b> at Empower, and I bring data and insight to strategic decisions, including new market launches, critical software improvements, and outgoing customer acquisition campaigns.
</p>

<p>
    I have a thorough understanding of our platform data, and the intersection of analytics and operations. I manage projects from start to finish, and understand the relationship between <b>speed</b>, <b>accuracy</b>, and <b>cost</b> in the startup environment.
</p>

<p>
    Outside of work I like to travel and spend time with friends and family. I have a lifelong obsession with <b>soccer</b> and I follow <b>Crystal Palace</b>; I’ve been to Selhurst Park once and I plan on going again in the future. I’m from the Greater Boston area.
